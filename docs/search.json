    "text": "By Henry Rochester\nLaRoche.ai is my sandbox for exploring the foundations of intelligence. I am curious about neural networks, reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and the structures underlying them.\nI am completing a triple major in Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Mathematical Statistics at the University of Cape Town, with a long-term focus on understanding artificial intelligence from first principles in order to create intelligence for the benefit of humankind.\nThis blog reflects four pillars that shape my approach to learning and building:\nAnalytical: mathematical meticulousness, structure and logic. Technical: a desire to deeply understanding the mechanics of neural networks and reinforcement learning so I can design, evaluate, and build systems from first principles. Strategic: long-term thinking for building systems that last, fueled by the will to lead a team through clarity of direction, shared purpose, stability, and trust. Philosophical: questioning our understanding, purpose, and truth. Always asking why.\nLaRoche, which means “rock” in French, represents the idea of something formed under pressure:\ndisciplined, truth-seeking and resilient - like a summit reached through steady, incremental steps.\nHere, I write to refine ideas, share my learning, and build the intellectual foundation needed to contribute meaningfully to the creation of intelligence."
